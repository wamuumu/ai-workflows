    "1": "Research investment opportunities across 3 cities (Tokyo, London, New York). For each city: get the weather forecast, if it's mostly clear weather search for outdoor tourism news and analyze sentiment, if it's rainy/cloudy search for indoor entertainment industry news instead. Then get the stock price for a major company in each city (Toyota for Tokyo, Barclays for London, Goldman Sachs for New York). If the stock price is above $100, calculate what a $50,000 investment would be worth with a 5% gain, otherwise calculate with a 10% expected loss. Compare the sentiment scores across all cities, cluster the news articles by topic, compute statistics on all stock prices. If the average sentiment is positive, write a bullish investment report to investments_bullish.txt, otherwise write a cautious report to investments_caution.txt.
