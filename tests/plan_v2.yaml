  # Goal: Prove that features improve any architecture.
  # ---------------------------------------------------------
  - id: "T5_FEAT_REFINEMENT"
    architecture: "monolithic"
    features: ["validation_refinement"]
    toolset: "standard"
    workflow: "structured"
    hypothesis: "Iterative refinement will improve 'Executability' and 'Connection Logic' metrics across architectures by catching and correcting errors."

    architecture: "monolithic"
    features: ["chat_clarification"]
    toolset: "standard"
    workflow: "structured"
    hypothesis: "Chat-based user clarification will improve 'User Intent' satisfaction by ensuring the generated workflow aligns better with user needs."

  # ---------------------------------------------------------
  # GROUP 4: ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
  # Goal: Test impact of toolset size and granularity (atomic vs standard).
  # ---------------------------------------------------------
  - id: "T7_ENV_ATOMIC"
    architecture: "bottom-up"
    features: []
    toolset: "atomic"
    workflow: "structured"
    hypothesis: "Using atomic tools should make workflows easier to validate and to understand, even if planning becomes more complex and more prone to errors."

  - id: "T8_ENV_MACRO"
    architecture: "bottom-up"
    features: []
    toolset: "macro"
    workflow: "structured"
    hypothesis: "Using macro tools should simplify planning and improve 'Connection Logic', but may reduce 'Executability' due to less granular control."

  - id: "T9_ENV_LIMITED"
    architecture: "bottom-up"
    features: []
    toolset: "limited (missing core tools)"
    workflow: "structured"
    hypothesis: "Using a limited toolset should challenge the model's ability to creatively combine tools, potentially reducing 'Executability' but testing adaptability."

  - id: "T10_ENV_OVERLAPPING"
    architecture: "bottom-up"
    features: []
    toolset: "overlapping (redundant tools)"
    workflow: "structured"
    hypothesis: "Using overlapping tools should test the model's ability to choose the most appropriate tool, potentially improving 'Connection Logic' but risking confusion and errors."
