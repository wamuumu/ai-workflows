Baseline: 
    - Monolithic strategy with linear workflow and all toolsets available.
    - Expected outcome: Don't work well, 1 section in the report

    - Monolithic strategy with linear workflow and Refinement
    - Expected outcome: Slightly better than above, but still not good

Monolithic strategy variations:
    - Monolithic strategy with structured workflow and all toolsets available.
    - Expected outcome: Better than baseline, because of structured workflow
    
    - Monolithic strategy with structured workflow and limited toolsets (maybe even none).
    - Expected outcome: Show that structured workflow is better even with limited toolsets

    - Monolithic strategy with structured workflow, all toolset available and chat-based clarification.
    - Expected outcome: Best performance, chat-based clarification helps a lot even in monolithic strategy

    - Monolithic strategy with structured workflow and Refinement
    - Expected outcome: Should be better, but not as good as chat-based clarification (missing information from user)

Iterative strategy variations:
    - Iterative strategy with structured workflow and all toolsets available.
    - Expected outcome: should work better than monolithic structured workflow (because of validator)

    - Iterative strategy with structured workflow and limited toolsets.
    - Expected outcome: validator should be less hallucinated

    - Iterative strategy with increasing rounds
    - Expected outcome: consistency and correctness should improve, efficiency should decrease

    - Iterative strategy with structured workflow, all toolset available and chat-based clarification.
    - Expected outcome: Best performance in iterative strategies, chat-based clarification helps a lot

Hierachical strategy variations:
    - Hierarchical strategy with structured workflow and all toolsets available.
    - Expected outcome: should work better than iterative structured workflow (because of intent resolution)

    - Hierarchical strategy with structured workflow and limited toolsets.
    - Expected outcome: intent resolution should help more in limited toolset scenario

    - Hierarchical strategy with structured workflow, all toolset available and chat-based clarification.
    - Expected outcome: Best performance overall, chat-based clarification helps a lot

    - Hierarchical strategy with structured workflow, all toolset available and refinement.
    - Expected outcome: should be good, but not as good as chat-based clarification

Final comparison:
    - Monolitich is the best in terms of efficiency
    - Hierarchical should outperform monolithic and iterative in reasoning coherence / intent resolution
    - Hierarchical should be the less efficient
